In this demo, I change the loading properties into sub-properties of the loadStatus object. Let us see what will happen if we observe a sub-property. After opening the console tab, we can check that the observer ran after the percentage sub-property was updated but remember it didn't run when we set the sub-property ourselves but only when we set the objects sub-property with the set methods that ran the notifyPath applying all of the changes. Also, with the asterisk symbol, we observed all of the sub-properties of an object and as an attribute now it will include an object and not the new and old value.
